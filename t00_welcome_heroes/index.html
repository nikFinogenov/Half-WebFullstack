    <h2 id="what-makes">What makes a superhero?</h2>

    <p>A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person
        couldn’t. So in order to be a superhero, <b>you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal
            human being could possess</b>, and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a
        policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero.<br> For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be
        just a regular police story or detective story or human-interest story. But if it’s a good guy with a superpower
        who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that a normal human
        being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.</p>

    <h2>My favorite superhero</h2>
    <img src="assets/images/t00.png" alt="angus" height="300">
    <p>Angus Mcfife</p>
    <p>He is the prince of the land of Fife,
        Noble and true with a heart of steel,
        Now it is lost vengeance shall be his,
        Angus McFife is his name.

        Across the wasteland, I ride upon swift steed,
        Behind me lies the burning ruins of Dundee,
        No turning back now, my journey lies ahead,
        I won't give up until the sorcerer is dead,
        A raging hero with a destiny of steel,
        With glory overcomes a mighty quest concealed.

        He is the prince of the land of Fife,
        Noble and true with a heart of steel,
        Now it is lost vengeance shall be his,
        Angus McFife is his name.

        In ancient castle, frozen for all time,
        Inside the dungeons my beloved waits to die,
        Ride fast for vengeance, but I must find a way,
        The force of unicorns makes Zargothrax fight great,
        Power of the sorcerer, too great to be controlled,
        Glenrothes trees will heal the torment in my soul.

        He is the prince of the land of Fife,
        Noble and true with a heart of steel,
        Now it is lost vengeance shall be his,
        Angus McFife is his name.</p>
